KuberLogic is an open-source platform that deploys and manages software on top of the Kubernetes cluster and turns infrastructure into a managed PaaS. It allows running managed databases and popular applications deploying on-premises or at any cloud. The solution provides API, monitoring, backups, and integration with SSO right out of the box.
